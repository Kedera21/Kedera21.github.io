	<h2 style = "font-family: cursive;font-size: 20pt;text-align: center;text-decoration: underline;color:yellow">1.)Using remote sensing to study the spread of crop diseases in Western Kenya.</h2>

	<p style = "font-family: times new roman;font-size: 18pt;color: white">In this project we use of satellite images that were obtained of the period of time in with the disease started and through its intensification to when it became a pandemic. To be able to monitor this change, the use of the Normalized Differance Vegetative Index(NDVI). This is because healthy and unhealthy plant have different spectral reflectance and thus through comparison of the NDVI from all the images the extent and spread of the disease can be obtained. A combination of both SAR and optical images is best suted for this.</p>

	<h3 style = "font-family: cursive;font-size: 20pt;text-align: center;text-decoration: underline;color:yellow">2.)Using satellite imagery to study salination in water reservoirs</h3>

	<p style = "font-family: times new roman;font-size: 18pt;color: white">In this case, since salty water and fresh water have different reflectance, the have different shades of color when viewed in a satellite image hence with an image of high spectral resolution and spatial resolution the water in rivers and in fresh water lakes can be studied to monitor their salination.</p>
